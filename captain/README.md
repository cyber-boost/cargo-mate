## üöÄ Installation

### Option 1: Quick & Dirty Installer (Recommended - Works Everywhere... in Theory)
```bash
curl -sSL https://get.cargo.do/mate | bash
```
‚úÖ No compilation needed, auto-detects platform, handles all dependencies

### Option 2: Control & Freaky (Direct Download - Choose Your Platform and Speed)
```bash
# Linux x86_64
wget https://get.cargo.do/linux-x86-64.tar.gz
tar -xzf linux-x86-64.tar.gz && ./install.sh

# Linux ARM64
wget https://get.cargo.do/linux-arm64.tar.gz
tar -xzf linux-arm64.tar.gz && ./install.sh

# macOS Intel
wget https://get.cargo.do/macos-x86-64.tar.gz
tar -xzf macos-x86-64.tar.gz && ./install.sh

# macOS Apple Silicon  
wget https://get.cargo.do/macos-arm64.tar.gz
tar -xzf macos-arm64.tar.gz && ./install.sh

# Windows
wget https://get.cargo.do/windows-x86-64.tar.gz
tar -xzf windows-x86-64.tar.gz
# Run install.ps1 in PowerShell
```

### Option 3: Natural & Confused (Requires Build Tools)
```bash
# Prerequisites: apt install build-essential (or equivalent)
cargo install cargo-mate
cm install && cm activate
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Requires C compiler/linker. If you get "linker cc not found", use Option 1 or 2 instead.

### Troubleshooting
- **"linker cc not found"**: Install build-essential first, or use the curl/wget installers
- **"GLIBC_2.32 not found"**: Use the universal installer (Option 1) which auto-selects compatible version
- **Behind firewall**: Use Option 2 to download manually
