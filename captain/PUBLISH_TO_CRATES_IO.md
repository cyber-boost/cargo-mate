# 🚀 Publishing Cargo Mate to Crates.io

This guide will walk you through publishing the source-protected cargo-mate to crates.io while keeping your source code secure.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Crates.io Account**: Create an account at [crates.io](https://crates.io)
2. **Cargo Login**: Run `cargo login` with your API token
3. **Protected Binaries**: Ensure all .protected binaries are built and ready
4. **Update Metadata**: Customize the `Cargo.toml` with your information

## 🔧 Pre-Publishing Checklist

### 1. Update Cargo.toml Information
```toml
[package]
name = "cargo-mate"  # Make sure this name is available on crates.io
authors = ["Your Real Name <your-real-email@example.com>"]
homepage = "https://github.com/yourusername/cargo-mate"
repository = "https://github.com/yourusername/cargo-mate"
```

### 2. Verify Binary Integrity
```bash
# Check that all protected binaries exist
ls -la captain/
# Should show: linux/, macos/, windows/ directories with .protected files

# Verify checksums match (if you have a checksums file)
sha256sum captain/linux/*.protected
```

### 3. Test Installation Locally
```bash
# Build the installer
cargo build --release

# Test the installer
./target/release/cargo-mate-installer

# Test the wrapper directly
cd captain/linux/
chmod +x ../wrapper-linux.sh
../wrapper-linux.sh --version
```

### 4. Update Version Number
```toml
version = "1.0.0"  # Increment for each release
```

## 📦 Publishing Process

### Step 1: Dry Run (Recommended)
```bash
# Test publish without actually publishing
cargo publish --dry-run
```

### Step 2: Check for Issues
Fix any issues that come up during dry run:
- Missing files
- License issues
- Metadata problems
- Include/exclude patterns

### Step 3: Publish to Crates.io
```bash
# Actually publish to crates.io
cargo publish
```

## 🔍 Post-Publishing Verification

### 1. Check Crates.io
Visit https://crates.io/crates/cargo-mate and verify:
- ✅ Package appears
- ✅ Version is correct
- ✅ Description is readable
- ✅ Download count starts at 0

### 2. Test Installation from Crates.io
```bash
# Test installing from crates.io
cargo install cargo-mate

# Verify it works
cm --version
cm --help
```

### 3. Verify Source Protection
```bash
# Check that source code is not included
cargo install --list | grep cargo-mate
# Should show the binary but no source files

# Verify the binary directory structure
ls -la ~/.cargo/bin/.cargo-mate/
# Should contain platform-specific .protected files
```

## 🏷️ Version Management

### Semantic Versioning
- **Major (x.0.0)**: Breaking changes
- **Minor (1.x.0)**: New features
- **Patch (1.0.x)**: Bug fixes

### Updating Versions
```bash
# For patch release
cargo search cargo-mate  # Check current version
# Update Cargo.toml version = "1.0.1"
cargo publish

# For minor release
# Update Cargo.toml version = "1.1.0"
cargo publish
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### 1. Encryption Key Management
- Keep your encryption key secure
- Document how to update binaries when needed
- Consider key rotation strategy

### 2. Binary Verification
- Provide checksums for manual verification
- Consider signing binaries with GPG
- Document verification process

### 3. Update Process
- Plan how users will get updates
- Consider backward compatibility
- Document breaking changes clearly

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Package name already taken"
- Choose a different name like `cargo-mate-cli` or `my-cargo-mate`
- Check availability: `cargo search your-package-name`

### "Authentication failed"
```bash
# Get your API token from https://crates.io/me
cargo login YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

### "Missing files" error
- Check your `include` and `exclude` patterns in Cargo.toml
- Ensure all required files exist
- Verify file permissions

### "License file not found"
- Ensure your LICENSE file is included
- Update `license` field in Cargo.toml if needed

## 📊 Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Track Downloads
```bash
# Check download stats
curl -s "https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/cargo-mate" | jq .downloads
```

### 2. Handle Issues
- Monitor GitHub issues
- Respond to user questions
- Fix bugs and release updates

### 3. Plan Updates
- Regular security updates
- Feature enhancements
- Performance improvements

## 🎯 Success Metrics
