### Known Issues
- `scat code` only renames function declarations, not their usage sites (your code won't compile)
- String "encryption" is just XOR - your nephew could reverse it
- No actual protection against anyone with 5 minutes and Google

### Developer Notes
This release represents a major expansion of Cargo Mate's capabilities with the introduction of the Captain system. The captain provides advanced development tools while maintaining the core philosophy of transparent, maintainable code.

The captain system introduces:
- **Encrypted binary distribution** for premium features
- **AI integration** for development assistance
- **Advanced workflow automation** for complex projects
- **Enterprise-grade tooling** for professional development

If you want real protection, use a server API for sensitive logic. The scat and strip tools are for:
- Making code less readable for contests/puzzles
- Satisfying managers who think obfuscation = security
- Learning why obfuscation in compiled languages is pointless

### Coming Never
- Actual working code obfuscation (it's harder than it looks)
- "Military-grade" encryption (whatever that means)
- A tool that makes your code both unreadable AND functional
